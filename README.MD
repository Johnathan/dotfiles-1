# dotfiles
dotfiles, configs I use on a day-to-day basis.

### Index
* [Atom](Atom/)
  * [Config](Atom/config.cson)
  * [Custom Styles](Atom/styles.less)
  * [Packages](Atom/packages.MD)
  * [Theme](Atom/theme/)
* [Terminal](Terminal/)
* [Git](Git/)

### General

* I use Atom editor for the past few months as I don't feel that Sublime has any bright future at the moment. I like how Atom is getting better and better and I got quite used to it now!
* Seti UI is theme of my choice.
