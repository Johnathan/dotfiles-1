# dotfiles
dotfiles, configs I use on a day-to-day basis.

### Index

  * [Packages](Atom/packages.MD)
  * [Themes](Atom/#themes)
* [Terminal](#terminal)
* [Git](Git/)

### Editor

* I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for the past few months as I don't feel that Sublime has any bright future at the moment. I like how Atom is getting better and better and I got quite used to it now!
* [Seti UI](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) is theme of my choice for [ui](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) and [syntax](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax).

### Terminal
* [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
  * [seti.itermcolors](seti.itermcolors)
  * [preferences.iterm2.plist](preferences.iterm2.plist)
* [Oh My ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh/)
  * [.zshrc](.zshrc)
